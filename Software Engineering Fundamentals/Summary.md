# Software Engineering Fundamentals — Overview

This section provides a concise foundation in software engineering: definitions, motivations, quality attributes, process basics, and a taxonomy of software types.

## Scope
- Short definitions and guiding principles
- Minimal theory; clear terminology
- Ready to expand later with examples/exercises

## Audience and Prerequisites
- Audience: CS/CE students and early-career developers
- Prerequisites: Basic programming literacy

## Learning Outcomes
By the end, you should be able to:
- Differentiate software, engineering, and software engineering
- Explain why software engineering practices matter (cost, time, reliability)
- Name and group key software quality characteristics
- Recognize major software categories (system, application, embedded, etc.)
- Describe at a high level what a software process is
